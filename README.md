# CSS framework challenge

A client needs a new website for her services. The designer you are collaborating with sent you a wireframe*. Your task is to turn this wireframe into an interactive HTML page so that the client can get a good idea if she likes the current structure or not.

Make sure that on tablet and on mobile the layout still works (for example, columns stack on top of each other, etc).

A wireframe is a schematic representation of the layout and structure of the page. It usually looks all grey. It is used to get approval on the structure, before proceeding with the real design.
